Ausländer
I travel a lot, I like to traveling
Far and near and near and far
I'm everywhere at home
My Language: international
I like to please everyone
Yeah my vocabulary is not bad
A sharp sword in the battle of words
With the other gender
 
I'm no man for a night
I stay maximum for one, two hours
Before the sun is laughing again
Am I already gone
And continue my rounds
 
I'm a stranger (stranger)
Mi amor, mon chéri
Stranger (stranger)
Ciao, ragazza, take a chance on me
I'm a stranger (stranger)
Mon amour Я люблю тебя
A stranger (stranger)
Come on, baby, c'est, c'est, c'est la vie
 
Other Countries, other tongues
So I do forced myself in the past
In the missunderstanding of frustration
That you have to learn Languages
And when the sun sets down
And you stand in front of strangers
Is it beneficial if you then
Being able to communicate
 
I'm no man for a night
I stay maximum for one, two hours
Before the sun is laughing again
Am I already gone
And continue my rounds
Hahahahahaha
 
I'm a stranger (stranger)
Mi amor, mon chéri
Stranger (stranger)
Ciao, ragazza, take a chance on me
I'm a stranger (stranger)
Mon amour Я люблю тебя
A stranger (stranger)
Come on, baby, c'est, c'est, c'est la vie
 
You come with me, I make you good
You come with me, I make you good
You come with me, I make you good
