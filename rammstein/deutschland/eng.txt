You have cried a lot
In the mind apart
In the heart united

We have been together for a very long time
Your breath is cold
The heart in flames
You

Germany
Your breath is cold
so young
and yet so old

and want to hate you
Overbearing (arrogant)
Superior

Germany

and yet so old
Germany
Your love is a curse and a blessing
Germany
My love I cannot give to you
