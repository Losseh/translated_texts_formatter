Harvest<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
<br>
Stay with me awhile<br>
<br>
Rise above the vile<br>
<br>
Name my final rest<br>
<br>
Poured into my chest<br>
<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1]<br>
<br>
Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate<br>
<br>
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait<br>
<br>
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead<br>
<br>
Halo of death, all I see is departure<br>
<br>
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr<br>
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
<br>
Pledge yourself to me<br>
<br>
Never leave me be<br>
<br>
Sweat breaks on my brow<br>
<br>
Given time ends now<br>
<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1]<br>
<br>
Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate<br>
<br>
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait<br>
<br>
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead<br>
<br>
Halo of death, all I see is departure<br>
<br>
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr<br>
<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
<br>
Spirit painted sin<br>
<br>
Embers neath my skin<br>
<br>
Veiled in pale embrace<br>
<br>
Reached and touched my face<br>
<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2]<br>
<br>
Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate<br>
<br>
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait<br>
<br>
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead<br>
<br>
(Release your grip, let me go, into the night)<br>
<br>
Halo of death, All I see is departure<br>
<br>
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr<br>
