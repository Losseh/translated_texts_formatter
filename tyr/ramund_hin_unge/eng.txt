The Young Raymond

"Raymond was a better man
if he was better clad"
The queen gave him fine clothes
of blueyarn, bast and leather
"I do not want such," said Raymond
"It does not suit me," said the yound Raymond

Raymond walked along the salty beach
There he saw seven giants standing
"I will take Raymond on my smallest hand.
And throw him far offshore"
"You will not do that alone," said Raymond
"You must come all seven of you," said the young Raymond

Raymond took his dear sword
The one he called the red Dimling
He hew the seven giants simultaneously
So that they bled to death
"There they lie, all seven of them," said Raymond
"And I still stand here," said the young Raymond

The Emperor looked out the window
In fright and with a sad face
"Who is that man that stands in the yard
and laughs so terribly"
"It is I, and I would like," said Raymond
"To challenge you to fight," said the young Raymond

Raymond took his large knife
The one he called the dear Dimling
He took the Emperor's Life
So that the head flew fifteen miles
"I thought it was blunt,- said Raymond
"And yet the blood flows,- said the yound Raymond
