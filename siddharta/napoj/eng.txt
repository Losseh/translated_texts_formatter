Napoj - eng

Have you noticed the time passing by so fast
All of us complaining over clocks
I'm aware of this
And I just watch it in peace

Glassy eyes, restless body
And no one cares about making things better
Now it's our moment
When the problem freezes

Let us pretend that nobody knows nothing

Let the devil be our sign today
Let them know who is this when the dust arises
Let the devil be our sign today
Let them know who is this when the dust arises

We will put all our worries aside
If someone needs us let him wait
Because it doesn't go that way any longer
We are burden to ourselves

We don't need calendar because we don't hurry anymore
And forget about the money, it's just a headache
Now it's our moment
When the problem freezes
