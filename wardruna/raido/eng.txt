Raido
Dark clouds drift within
The longing lures pulls my mind
Will you carry me?
I want to go
 
Fair foal, I bid you
Sacks rich with gold of the fields
Fare swiftly on flying hoofs
Carry me, and I promise you
Ride out
Raido
 
The storm is stilled, the mind it flies
The drum of hoofs lay the beat
The heart, it follows, two are one
Sets me loose with speedy feet
Riding
Raido
 
Wild I rode and ran
Fair foal I spent
The ride is for the horse the worse
Pleasant and swift for the sitting
Raido
Raido
 
If I ride you
I ride more
As one is two,
where knots are tied
In bonds are bound
the whole world
If I bond you
I can journey
 
If you carry me
You carry more
As one is two
where chains are forged
In bonds are bound
the whole world
If you bond me
You can journey
