Thorir Hund
The eagle has fallen
resting in forgetfull sleep
The crow has croaked in the eagle's nest
Believing itself equal
 
Proud legacy
You never won (aldri=never, o.e. aldr=wiek)
Poor was the pay
Slayer of the king of shame
 
People of the land gathered
Flocks followed
Defied starvation
Chieftain of the peasant-army
 
Onwards, onwards peasant-men
Tore Hund arises again!
Onwards, onwards peasant-men
From forgetful sleep he rises again!
 
Even after death
The piteous king enjoys his feed
Fills a greedy belly
with power and wisdom absent
 
Manipulative rumor
Was cultivated
Stupidifying the land!
Silencing the land!
 
A tree without nourish
Rots on it's roots
A tree without roots
...Falls
 
Onwards, onwards peasant-men
Tore Hund arises again!
Onwards, onwards peasant-men
From forgetful sleep he rises again!
