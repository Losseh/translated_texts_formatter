Troll Women's lure

"Block hoisted up on golden pillar"
So spoke a forest man in coat of wolf skin
Who had slept a night at the foot of the spruce mountain
And there underneath heard the calling of the troll women

Soon the they rose, they who had hidden the erratic blocks
And humming songs so whisperingly tender
The pulling force tore in the bone-case
The warning words he had now forgotten

[Chorus:]
For these may not be mentioned by name
Then, the agony pendulum starts its eternal going
And he took these in his arms
Lulled by inebriation in whirling leaps
Snared by their catch he is led

Like glittering drops over the edge of the rainbow
A blinding bundle of rays from the land of mountain caves
The crystalline light in the world of the troll women

The bliss in the heart now burst
Assiduously the echo of the luring calls cut sharply
His pleading prayer does not make him free
Only valerian root and february daphne helps now8

[Chorus:]
For these may not be mentioned by name
Then, the agony pendulum starts its eternal going
And he took these in his arms
Lulled by inebriation in whirling leaps
Snared by their catch he is led
