The Leaf Lady

On the moss adorned ground of the desolate moor
The house-tree stands against the strong autumn wind
Surrounded by a mantle of bark
Its crown sprouts towards the sky
An ancient trunk renowned along mountain land and plains
Invisible in the great foliage
The leaf lady dwells in the power of the storm
Among lichens that decorate the stem

Tree spirits' dance in the rich leaf-crown
The ring dance goes to autumnal music
A play now hidden in mysticism
By cairns and dark spruces
Streams of blood leak from the tree's root
When the defiler has put his blade at its foot
This desecrating act demands its sacrifice
Now the life flame slowly fades

[Chorus:]
The leaf lady's remedy
Healing richness
Releases from the curse of agony
Midlan's power found the depth of the soul
The l√∂vjerska's remedy
Healing richness
Gifted by forest dryad
In the enigmatic sacrificial grove
