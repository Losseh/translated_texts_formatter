The Troll Castle

In the mountain story is told about gloomy paths in many-mile forests
A brushy path flanked by troll women who have turned into stone
In branches is the desolate wailing from the wind's ardour heard
What lures behind the next corner, beyond the glare of the will-o-the-wisps?
Your fear is greater than that of becoming predator food
When you tread the path forward in mystic labyrinth
In hard, winding wander, an endless slaving toiling
Through the depth of the kettle valley up towards high peak

At its end the great shadow delights human eye
Lures bewitchingly in evening sundown with castlelike silhouette
With drawbridge over moat, the towers blazes tall
Like from a beacon, the strong light play clothes the triumphal arch
A avskorligt1 kingdom in the wide coats of the clouds
Below the court of the midnight flame is now seen walking
Heavy steps up the ancient temple stairs of the mountain
When moon goes high in the sky, they praise the night's glory


In the troll castle
Troll castle, dwelling of tale winds
Troll castle
Troll castle

The shadows' rune chanting from this crowd
A gloomy hymn of ore-clang voices from heathen vaults
The horrible primeval trolls now sing in northern tounge
The mountain itself trembles before the being of this primeval life form

Like prey in stony realm you are scornfully watched
They turn your vision's images, also your words
And never shall you get mercy from the claws of the primordial castle
For you was offered brew of oblivion at the table of the troll king


In the troll castle
Troll castle, dwelling of tale winds
Troll castle
Troll castle
