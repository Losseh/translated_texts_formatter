The Bog Lady Is Lighting A Fire

The dense and ghostlike haze
The bog lady is lightning a fire
Now besieges the brush woods of the juniper thickets
The bog lady is lightning a fire
In purple shift and the crown of twilight
The lady of the haze, prophesing wise
Enthrones bog lands

The choking smoke of sour wood
The bog lady is lightning a fire
Seen by raveness and hawk
The bog lady is lightning a fire
Now it billows forth around the slender birches
From cauldron fire in the witches' kitchen
By the swampy bog mire

[Chorus:]
The night becomes harsh
Silence is broken
By kettle drum under the earth from overgrown halls
The night becomes harsh
Silence is broken
Overmindly hero verse over wilderness married valleys

In the mightily rough primordial forest
The bog lady is lightning a fire
The fog smoke finds its prey
The bog lady is lightning a fire
All are mislead to the stronghold of judgement
Are exposed for the final test
In ghostly nest

A wraith from soot and mud
The bog lady is lightning a fire
Over roof ridge in cottage village
The bog lady is lightning a fire
From the captured the wailing is heard
Echoing towards grey clouded sky
Along the adventure path

[Chorus:]
The night becomes harsh
Silence is broken
By kettle drum under the earth from overgrown halls
The night becomes harsh
Silence is broken
Overmindly hero verse over wilderness married valleys
