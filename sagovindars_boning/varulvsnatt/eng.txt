Werewolf Night

You guide wolf minds at nightfall
When darkness surrounds countryside and district
In fair guise and chiaroscuro
You slowly rise splendorous

You were revered in aged belief
Sealed wisdom forgotten in the course of time
The power still grows from the myth
We are urged to bear it in mind

[Chorus:]
Venerable the mood stands gilded
Now loudly wail in bide
A creepily howling wolfkin

You calmly travel at the verge of the sky
Along the trail of the star sprinkled night
Settled the sky since the dawn of time
And gifted your edge over waters

The poor soul under the magic of the moon
Embodied in kettle chain's arms
Possessed by ghost in forest regions
Until the daybreak releases

[Chorus:]
Venerable the mood stands gilded
Now loudly wail in bide
A creepily howling wolfkin

You guide wolf minds at nightfall
When darkness surrounds countryside and district
In fair guise and chiaroscuro
You slowly rise splendorous

You were revered in aged belief
Sealed wisdom forgotten in the course of time
The power still grows from the myth
We are urged to bear it in mind

[Chorus:]
Venerable the mood stands gilded
Now loudly wail in bide
A creepily howling wolfkin
