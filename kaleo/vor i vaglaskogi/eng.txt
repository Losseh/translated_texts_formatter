Spring in Vagla-woods

The evening is ours and spring about Vaglask√≥g,
let's camp with the green berries
Lead a friend in the grove since yesterday,
the spring where the nips and the birches grow.
 
Game in light and perfuming roses,
play in the light of the cunning blur.
 
Daylight glitters the valley moves calmly,
His dreams come true that stay in Vagla-Woods.
Evening-red shine on the black berries strikes.
The tranquility is peaceful, mild and calming
 
Game in light lids and perfuming roses,
play in the light of the cunning blur.
 
Game in light and angry roses,
play in light the cunning blur,
play in light of the cunning blur.
